# Marketplace for Cosmos

This repo is a marketplace for Cosmos ServApps.
It will be for testing or maybe also my own ServApps.

## How to use

Go to Market in Cosmos UI, and then click 'Sources'.
Add the url `https://julowe.github.io/cosmos-marketplace`
to the sources list, give it a name, and save it.

## Stable Apps

Unless otherwise listed below, assume the other apps in this marketplace are
either some random configuration I wanted, or are not stable enough for general
use.

- [Obsidian LiveSync Server](./servapps/obsidian-livesync-server/cosmos-compose.json)
- [Vikunja](./servapps/vikunja/cosmos-compose.json)
